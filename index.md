# Welcome to my homepage#

I am a Ph.D student both in [Northwestern Polytecnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in China and [University of
Rennes 1](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in France. My major is
mathematics in my bachelor and master periods. Now I am pursing my doctoral degree in information. When learning maths, 
programming is easier for me. But when learning programming, mathematic is too difficult. My favourite programming language is
R. An old saying goes like that the one who only uses R and MatLab is not a real programmer. In order to let myself 
believe that I am a programmer, I use vim for editing R scripts. It is really amazing of the trip with vim since we can sit in
front the computer without figures leaving the keyboard. I am obsessive-compulsive for the softwares in the computer. All the  
configurations in the software should be what I want. Otherwise I could not work even when there are some urgent tasks. After 
installing or recovering the operating system, I will spend nearly half a day to set the configurations of the common used 
softwares, like the R and latex plug-ins in vim, the inverse and forward search between Winedt and sumatraPDF, the 
global short keys by AHK, Cygwin in windows, the plug-ins in Google Chromes and Firefox... People usually say that Linux is more
stable than windows. But I have re-installed Ubuntu on win7 for  more than five times in one week due to the problem is Ubuntu 
system. Now when I work on Ubuntu, I will be so careful when shutting down the computer in case it will not wake up next time. 
But in windows, every night I will use "shutdown -s -f -t 3600" before I go to sleep and listen  cross talk or documentary film
for one hour.
